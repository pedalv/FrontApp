# webpack 2 demo
- Open 'Webpack2/webpack-demo/index.html' file on a browser.

## Install library
```bash
npm install --save lodash
```
## Now run webpack on this folder with index.js as the entry file and bundle.js as the output file in which all code required for the page is bundled.
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack app/index.js dist/bundle.js
```
# webpack 2 demo with a config
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

# Using webpack with npm
- Adjust package.json to set a little shortcut like this:
```bash
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack"
  },
```
```bash
npm run build -- --colors
```
